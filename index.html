        <h3>Climbing</h3>
        <p>A huge part of this society is the climbing. We have several very
          experienced indoor and outdoor climbers. As well as frequent weekend
          trips away to the Lake District, Peak District, Yorkshire Dales, North
          Wales and more (giving us lots of outdoor climbing opportunities), we
          also run weekly trips to Warwick University's indoor climbing centre.

        <h3>Hiking</h3>
        <p>
          Another favourite in this society is hiking. Most weekend trips away
          will offer hiking of some description, from gentle strolls with lunch
          at the pub, to full days, scaling epic mountains. We have also had
          workshop walks, learning navigational skills along the way, run by
          experienced outdoor experts.

        <h3>Ghyll Scrambling</h3>
        <p>Fancy jumping into a freezing cold river and then climbing up it?
          Sounds like ghyll scrambling is for you. There are opportunities away
          on weekend trips to try ghyll scrambling, but you'll need your own wet
          suit, learn more over on the equipment page!

        <h3>Caving</h3>
        <p>
          If being in total darkness, crawling through mud and water, squeezing
          through tiny passageways appeals, then you should definitely give
          caving a go. We have several experienced cavers, and whenever possible
          throw ourselves underground. There's nothing quite like it as an
          experience, we cannot recommend it enough!
