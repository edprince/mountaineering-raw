        We rely very heavily on our equipment a lot of the time whilst
        mountaineering, so it's important you know what equipment you need and
        how to use it. This page is designed for you to familiarize yourself
        with some of the equipment that you will probably encounter as being a
        member of this club. It will also give you suggested retailers for
        purchasing items.
